# Given an integer array, output all the unique pairs that
# sum up to a specific value k.
#  output (1,4) and (2,3)
# for testing purposes change your function so it outputs a number of pairs

#     count = 0

# The O(N) algorithm uses the set data structure. We perform a linear pass from the beginning and
# for each element we check whether k-element is in the set of seen numbers. If it is, then we found
# a pair of sum k and add it to the output. If not, this element doesnâ€™t belong to a pair yet, and we
# add it to the set of seen elements.
#
# The algorithm is really simple once we figure out using a set. The complexity is O(N) because we do
# a single linear scan of the array, and for each element we just check whether the corresponding number
# to form a pair is in the set or add the current element to the set. Insert and find operations of a set
# are both average O(1), so the algorithm is O(N) in total.
